# data-visualization-projects

A collection of data visualization projects across various domains, showcasing insights through Python-based exploratory analysis.

📊 Data Visualization Projects
This repository is a curated collection of data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects across multiple domains. Each subfolder contains a self-contained project, including datasets, Jupyter notebooks, and visual outputs that uncover insights from real-world data.

The goal of this collection is to showcase practical data storytelling using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and others. These projects span domains such as economics, health, energy, environment, and more.

📁 Project Structure
Each project lives in its own subfolder and typically includes:

Raw or cleaned data in a data/ directory
A Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and visualizations
A brief README.md explaining the project

🧠 Topics Covered
📈 US Debt Analysis (1966–2024)
Exploring historical trends in United States federal debt and its economic implications.


🔧 Tech Stack
Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
Pandas, Numpy
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
GeoPandas (for spatial maps) – where applicable

📌 Note
This repository is regularly updated with new visualization case studies and is intended for learning, portfolio-building, and sharing insight-driven narratives through data.
